First you'll be presented with 50 posts from reddit, this are the top posts at the moment.

You can navigate to a detailed view from the post if tap on the row, however, if you tap on the thumbnail, you'll be redirected to the url reddit provided, this could a post, an image or a gif.

Once you visited a post, if you navigate back, you'll notice that the blue dot at the top right will dissappear, that's the status indicator that shows you whether you read a post or not.

You can navigate back and forth from the dashboard with posts to the detailed view.
